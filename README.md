# SoftEther Autoinstaller

This is my SoftEther autoinstaller. This script will *hopefully* make your life a little easier. I have not made **any** modifications to the SoftEther VPN Project code at all, this script simply downloads the latest build and compiles it for use on your supported system.

To get started, all you have to do is copy/paste the provided code for your OS. The script will handle everything else for you. Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/icoexist/softether-autoinstall#quick-start-guide) if you need to get set up quickly. Also refer to the [Commands List](https://github.com/icoexist/softether-autoinstall#commands-list) should you need them.

### Please note:
The Ubuntu installer is created for and on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. It is **strongly** recommended that you use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS when using the Ubuntu installer.

The CentOS installer is created for and on CentOS 7 Minimal. It is **strongly** recommended that you use CentOS 7 Minimal when using the CentOS installer.

## Uninstall SE-VPN Server [Ubuntu Only]
As of now, this bash script will only work with Ubuntu due to the use of `update-rc.d`.
```
wget -O se-uninstall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icoexist/softether-autoinstall/master/ubuntu/se-uninstall.bash && chmod 770 se-uninstall && ./se-uninstall
```

## Configure SoftEther
### Execute vpncmd
To execute SoftEther's cmd utility, use `sudo /usr/local/vpnserver/vpncmd` <-- This applies if you used my scripts. If you've installed SE yourself, find the vpnserver directory.

With `vpncmd` you are able to change every option in regard to SoftEther. It has the same exact purpose for the GUI version you can obtain on MacOS and Windows. I encourage people to use `vpncmd` because it can be easier than the GUI, plus there's no need to download anything since you can configure the entire server from an SSH session.

### Set a server password
It is important that you set a server password. This should be the first thing you do after launching the `vpncmd` utility. To set a password, type `serverpasswordset` into your terminal after you've launched the `vpncmd` utility. For verification, you have to type the password twice.

### Quick-start Guide
This section will provide you with a list of things to get you started with your VPN server. I'll have more commands listed below this section.

1. Start the `vpncmd` utility with `sudo /usr/local/vpncmd`
2. Set a server password with `ServerPasswordSet`
3. Select the DEFAULT hub with `hub default`
4. Create a new user with `UserCreate` | You can either use `UserCreate` or `UserCreate [username]`
5. Set a password for the new user with `UserPasswordSet` | You can either use `UserPasswordSet` or `UserPasswordSet [username]`
6. Enable SecureNAT for the DEFAULT hub with `SecurenatEnable`

   Optional: You can enable L2TP/IPsec with `IpsecEnable`. It is recommended that if you use this option, you only enable L2TP/IPsec. Do not enable RAW L2TP w/o encrpytion. You will be asked to set a pre-shared key for the IPsec server, you can use anything. I've used `vpn` as a pre-shared key for ages. Remember that this is NOT a password for the server or a user, so it's safe to use that. You'll also be asked for the default hub in the event that a user does not specify the hub to connect to in their username, you'll set this to `default` if you haven't changed any hub names. If you're more advanced user and have multiple hubs, you can specify what hub a user connects to by putting it in their username on the client. For instance `icoexist@public` or `icoexist@hub2`.

If everything was done properly, you're ready to use your new VPN server! To add new users, just launch the `vpncmd` utility and repeat steps 3 - 5.

### Other Options
#### Change SoftEther Ports
You can change the ports that SoftEther VPN server will use to listen for incoming connections. If you're using the `vpncmd` utility, you can list the current ports with `listenerlist`.

`ListenerCreate` - Creates a new listener on a specified port   
`ListenerDelete` - Deletes a listener on a specfied port   
`ListenerEnable` - Enables a listener on a specified port   
`ListenerDisable` - Disables a listener on a specified port

#### Manage Users & User Policies
SoftEther VPN server allows you to manage users and their policies. Below are some popular commands and descriptions on what they do. Remember that you first have to select a hub before you can manage users, as each hub has its own users.

`UserList` - Displays a list of users   
`UserGet [username]` - Displays information on a specified user   
`UserCreate [username]` - Creates a user   
`UserPasswordSet [username]` - Sets a password for specified user   
`UserDelete` - Deletes a specified user   
`UserPolicySet` - Sets a policy for a specified user | It is recommended that you enable "Privacy Filter Mode" on all newly created users on the same hub, unless you WANT them to see each other. To do this, type `UserPolicySet` then when it asks for what policy, type `PrivacyFilter`. It will ask for the new value, to enable it enter `1`, to disable it enter `0`.   
`UserPolicyRemove` - Removes a policy from a specified user

#### Manage Hubs & Hub Policies
SoftEther VPN server also allows you to manage virtual hubs and their policies. Below are some popular commands and descriptions on what they do. Remember that you first have to select a hub before you can manage it.

`Hub [HubName]` - Selects a hub for management   
`HubCreate [HubName]` - Creates a new virtual hub   
`HubDelete [HubName]` - Deletes a specified hub   
`HubList` - Lists the virtual hubs on the VPN server   
`AdminOptionList` - Get List of Virtual Hub Administration Options   
`AdminOptionSet` - Set Values of Virtual Hub Administration Options
